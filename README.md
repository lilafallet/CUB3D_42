# CUB3D_42

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever : Wolfenstein 3D, and learn about ray-casting. The goal of this project is to make a dynamic view inside a maze with the theme from the serie Doctor Who, in which you’ll have to find your way. Enjoy !
