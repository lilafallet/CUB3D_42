# CUB3D_42

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90â€™s game, which was the very first FPS ever : Wolfenstein 3D. The purpose of this project is to learn about raycasting and to make a dynamic view inside a maze in which you will have to find your way. Enjoy this Doctor Who theme !
